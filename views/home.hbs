                <span class="first-letter">T</span>his semester, I am taking WEB322
                course at my college which covers fundamanetal backend Web technologies
                including Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and many more. So
                far, I have gotten the oppurtunity to go over Node.js and Express.js,
                and to be honest, my experience has been like a rollercoaster ride with
                a steep learning curve. Initially, I had huge troubel in understanding
                the concepts of Express - how routing works, what is middleware, why is
                middleware and so on. But, I didn't give up and kept researching on the
                internet for my doubts and never stopped reading the notes. Gradually,
                it all started making sense and now I feel comfortable with building
                routes for websites and the notion of promises, middleware and route
                handling.
