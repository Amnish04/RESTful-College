                <span class="first-letter">T</span>his semester, I am taking WEB322
                course at my college which covers fundamanetal backend Web technologies
                including Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and many more. So
                far, I have gotten the oppurtunity to go over Node.js and Express.js,
                and to be honest, my experience has been like a rollercoaster ride with
                a steep learning curve. Initially, I had huge troubel in understanding
                the concepts of Express - how routing works, what is middleware, why is
                middleware and so on. But, I didn't give up and kept researching on the
                internet for my doubts and never stopped reading the notes. Gradually,
                it all started making sense and now I feel comfortable with building
                routes for websites and the notion of promises, middleware and route
                handling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding to that knowledge, we also learnt several other technologies complementing
                Express framework later in the semester like View Engines &lpar;<em>Handlebars</em>&rpar;, 
                implementing persistent storage for the web application by connecting with a live database.
                For relational databases, we learnt communicating to a Postgres database &par;what this application uses&rpar;
                with sequelize module and for NOsql we learnt MongoDB. Other than that, we also learnt about browser &lpar;cookies
                are stored on server as well&rpar; storages like Cookies and Sessions along with basic encryption in HTTPS.
